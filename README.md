# Simple-ReverseShell
Here is my small project where i made a reverse shell script for server and client. It can be usable for many things. Next to each line of code I left an explanation for it. I hope you like the script and use it.

Download a scripts and change ip address in client and server script. You can change and port but ip and port must to be same in client and server.This code is bulit on python 3.8.5.

DO NOT USE FOR ANY ILLEGAL THING !
